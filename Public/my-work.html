    <h1>My Previous Work: </h1>
    <h2>As a Ui/Ux Desginer for my team WorkHorse: </h2>
    <p>Our StartUp idea with workhorse was to allow regular people like you and me invest in some seeded start ups and get some stock in that company.</p>
    <p>This helps the young startup by giving them more investments to work off of.</p>
    <p>if the company in question makes it big you can then sell the stock and get the money</p>
    <p>To be sure that your money isn't going to waste you can talk to the people behind the startup in the app and see if your values align with theirs. You can also look at their important financial details and make a decision from there.</p>
